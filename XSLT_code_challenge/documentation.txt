Based on the given XML, I have created a XSLT which collects the attriburtes of "degree" elements and display it in the table. 

There are two ways to display the XML feed. 
 	i) By clicking on the degree.xml file, the file is processed by XSLT ( which has html) and it displays the feed in Table.

 	ii) I have created a HTML5 page index.html with uses XML DOM, it helps to retrive the data from degree.xml and display it in html page.

I have used Sublime Text and Oxygen XML Editor.
